            This document is a reference guide for <ulink url="http://jtrac.info">JTrac</ulink>
            - the generic issue tracking web-application.  This document is not only a user-guide
            but can also serve as a reference for developers interested in contributing to JTrac.

            This documentation has been generated using the DocBook configuration 
            used by the <ulink url="http://www.springframework.org">Spring</ulink> development team. 
            This particular simplified DocBook helper package was originally developed by Chris Bauer of the
            <ulink url="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</ulink> project.  Thanks go out to all those who

            <para>
                JTrac is a generic issue-tracking web-application that can be easily customized by adding 
                custom fields and drop-downs. Features include customizable workflow, field level permissions, 
                e-mail integration, file attachments and a detailed history view.
            </para>
            <para>
                JTrac was created after the author felt that he could write a much better alternative to a 
                commercial defect tracking tool that he was having to use. Development started in 2004. 
                JTrac is ideal for issue tracking or bug-tracking, but it has been designed to be generic
                and you can define custom fields to track almost anything you need.
            </para>
            <para>
                JTrac development used to be hosted at <ulink url="https://jtrac.dev.java.net"/> but moved to SourceForge 
                in early 2006. The older working version was based on Spring MVC, Spring JDBC and MS Access and is not being 
                maintained any more.  JTrac 2.0 uses Java 5.0 features and was completely re-written to use 
                <ulink url="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</ulink> for persistence and the 
                <ulink url="http://www.acegisecurity.org/">Acegi Security</ulink> framework for Spring.  The presentation 
                layer for version 2.0 was mainly using 
                <ulink url="http://opensource.atlassian.com/confluence/spring/display/WEBFLOW/Home">Spring WebFlow</ulink>
                but as of early 2007 (version 2.1.0 onwards) JTrac 
                <ulink url="http://ptrthomas.wordpress.com/2007/03/02/wicket-impressions-moving-from-spring-mvc-webflow/">switched to </ulink>
                using the <ulink url="http://wicket.apache.org/">Apache Wicket</ulink> framework.
            </para>
            <para>
                JTrac is extremely easy to install and the only pre-requisite is a Java 5 (or higher) Runtime Environment.
                You can be up and running in seconds because JTrac comes bundled with a small-footprint web-application 
                server called <ulink url="http://jetty.mortbay.org/">Jetty</ulink> and an embedded database called 
                <ulink url="http://www.hsqldb.org/">HSQLDB</ulink>.  Please refer to the 
                <link linkend="installation">installation</link> section of this documentation for details.  
                You can also choose to drop the WAR file into an application server of your choice and start using JTrac right away.

            <para>
                There are no database changes between version 2.0 and 2.1.0.  Instructions on how to upgrade are 
                available in the "<link linkend="upgrading">upgrading</link>" section of this document.  The bundled
                Jetty web-app server has been upgraded from version 6.0.2 to 6.1.1 but it is not mandatory that you
                upgrade.

            JTrac has all the features that you would expect from a standard issue-tracking application such as 
            support for file-attachments and e-mail integration.  JTrac offers powerful customization options,
            especially in the areas of workflow and field-level permissions and compares well to even
            commercial tools.

            <title>Easy to Install</title>
            <para>
                One of the useful features of JTrac is that it is distributed with an embedded web-application server 
                (<ulink url="http://jetty.mortbay.org/">Jetty</ulink>) that has a very small footprint.  
                If you have Java 5 installed you can be up and running after downloading and extracting JTrac - by 
                simply using the provided start and stop scripts.  JTrac scans its environment on startup and if a 
                configured database is not detected, <ulink url="http://www.hsqldb.org/">HSQLDB</ulink> is used by 
                default.

            <para>
                If you already have a web-application server that you wish to use (such as 
                <ulink url="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</ulink>), you can just drop in the WAR file 
                provided and sign on into the application straight-away.

                You can refer the <link linkend="installation">installation</link> section of this document for 
                more details.  JTrac uses <ulink url="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</ulink> and so it can 
                use any database <ulink url="http://www.hibernate.org/80.html">supported by Hibernate.</ulink>

            <para>                    
                JTrac can be used to effectively track various kinds of things such as Bugs, Action Items and Tasks.
                You can easily add the following types of custom fields to a tracker Project (Space):
                <itemizedlist>

                There is a limit to how many custom fields of each type that you can configure for a Space.
                These limits have been set after careful consideration and would very rarely fail to suffice. 
                They are as follows: Drop Down - 10, Free Text - 5, Numeric - 3, Date/Time - 3.

                The screenshot below shows how creating a new item would look like for the typical

                as custom fields.

            <title>Custom Workflow</title>
            <para>
                Each tracker project that you create can have a different workflow.  JTrac allows for 
                complete customization of the tracker-item lifecycle, right down to the names of
                each intermediate state.  It is possible to create very sophisticated workflows and a visual 
                "map" of the workflow being edited is displayed below the state-transition toggle-buttons 
                to make it easier to manage.
            </para>
            <para>
                The default workflow shown below is ideal if you simply want to track issues with just
                two states - Open and Closed.  However, with just a few mouse clicks, you can turn this into 
                a complex workflow involving multiple states.

            <para>
                You can even configure whether or not changing of values is permitted given the current state 
                within the workflow - and that too at a field-level.  This flexibility allows for some 
                interesting possibilities.  For example, assume that you want to maintain a "percentage complete" 
                field that can be updated at any time during the life-cycle of an item. The screenshot below 
                demonstrates how you can set up a drop down field called "% Complete":
            </para>
            <para>
                <mediaobject>

                </mediaobject>
            </para>
            <para>
                Then when customizing the roles and field-level permissions, all you need to do is specify that
                the "% Complete" field is editable even when the status is "Open".
            </para>

                This results in the "% Complete" field being available for updating whenever anyone views an item

                section so that the complete history of changes to this custom field can be viewed.

                JTrac provides a very detailed history view that completely captures all comments or status

            <title>Custom Roles</title>
            <para>
                JTrac customization does not stop at workflow - you can also define different roles for each tracker
                project that you set up.  This allows for power and flexibility.  For example you could enforce that
                a "DEVELOPER" role can only mark "Assigned" items as "Fixed" and that only a "TESTER" role has the
                power to mark a "Fixed" item as "Closed".  You can even disallow selected roles from being able to 
                create new items.  JTrac gives you complete control over the workflow and you can easily tweak it 
                to fit your existing process rather than the other way around.
            </para>           
            <para>

            <para>              
                In the example above, the roles highlighted in red on the visual "map" of the workflow being edited 
                mean that at these points in the workflow - a user with the given role can assign only to other roles.  
                So in this case, the TESTER can assign a New item only to a DEVELOPER role and not another TESTER.
                And when an item is in the "Assigned" state, a DEVELOPER can only assign to a TESTER when changing the
                status to "Fixed" or "Rejected".
            </para>
            <para>              
                Field-level permissions can be mapped to roles which allows for even more flexibility. 
                For example, you can set a project up so that only a "MANAGER" can change the "Severity" level 
                after a bug is submitted.  JTrac makes it possible for you to define very complex workflows, complete 
                with both Status and Role dependent field-level permissions, and you can do all this within a 
                single admin screen.

                The intuitive search screen (shown below) allows for easy execution of common queries such as
                find all items "logged by" or "assigned to" a user (or users).  JTrac allows for filtering even
                on custom fields.
            </para>
            <para>
                You can navigate back to the search setup screen from the search results screen and have the

            <para>
                The default view when you log into JTrac is a very handy dashboard view that provides the most 
                frequently used statistics at a glance. You can click on any of the numbers to immediately bring up 
                the search results view listing the items matched. For example, clicking on the count of items 
                "Logged By Me" would immediately display the list of items initiated by the currently logged in user.

                whether 'logged by me' / 'assigned to me' - but against the custom workflow states defined for 
                the Space as well.  Again, it is possible to directly navigate to the items by clicking on the dashboard numbers.

                all (or a sub set of) projects that a user is mapped to.  For example, in the screenshot of the
                dashboard above, there are two projects.  The "SEARCH" link at the top of the page (as well as the "search"
                link on the "totals" row) would bring up the search wizard that can search across all (or a subset of)
                the spaces assigned to the currently logged in user.

                    For security reasons, it is best that you change the default "admin" password after installing 
                    JTrac, especially if you are going to make the application accessible on a public-facing web-site
                    over the internet.  Do refer the section (coming up below) on what data to back up as well.

                For e-mail notifications to work, an SMTP server needs to be configured in JTrac.
                Users who have the ADMIN role will be able to access the JTrac configuration settings
                screen from a link on the "OPTIONS" screen.  Note that you will need to provide values
                for the "mail.from" and the "jtrac.url.base" properties also, for things like the hyperlinks
                within e-mail to work properly.  JTrac also supports mail servers that require authentication
                or secure connections using SSL.  You can refer the descriptions of the available configuration 
                property settings available from the settings screen as shown below.

                If you have trouble getting e-mail to work, one of the things to watch out for is whether
                there is any firewall blocking the communication between JTrac and the mail server - for example
                you may have a firewall runnning on the machine where JTrac is installed.  It is very common
                for mail servers to be configured to prevent mail-relay requests from unknown applications or
                IP addresses so you may need to check with your mail server administrator.

            <title>Using only the WAR file</title>
            <para>
                JTrac is designed so that you can be up and running by just deploying the WAR file into your 
                existing web-application server.  Note that you need a servlet 2.4 compliant container.  
                For example, if you have <ulink url="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</ulink> 5.5.X, 
                you can either copy the WAR file into the [tomcat.home]/webapps folder or choose to upload 
                the WAR file through the Tomcat console.
            </para>
            <para>                    
                JTrac saves database information and uploaded attachments into a directory on the server.
                This directory is logically called the "jtrac.home".  When you do a "quick-install" of JTrac
                by just deploying the WAR file, JTrac creates a ".jtrac" folder in the user home folder and
                uses that location as the home directory.  This is great for quickly evaluating JTrac but
                when you actually use JTrac in production you should configure the JTrac home directory as 
                a location that can easily be backed-up for example.

                To customize the location of "jtrac.home" you have the following three options.  On startup, JTrac tries to

                <para>
                    If you can easily set a system property called "jtrac.home" within the environment of your 
                    application server then you don't need to edit the WAR file.  Please look at the contents of "start.bat" 
                    to see an example of how the appropriate JVM (Java Virtual Machine) parameters can be set when deploying JTrac.  
                    For example, if you are using <ulink url="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</ulink> 5.5.X, you can 
                    set an environment variable called JAVA_OPTS before invoking the startup script (startup.bat / startup.sh).
                    Here is an example for Tomcat 5.5.X on Windows:

                <para>
                    If "jtrac.home" has not been configured in any of the above ways, JTrac will create a folder called
                    ".jtrac" in the user home directory and proceed to use that as "jtrac.home".

                You can configure the database that JTrac uses by editing the "jtrac.properties" file that JTrac expects
                within the "jtrac.home" folder.  Note that if JTrac does not find a "jtrac.properties" file in the
                expected location, JTrac creates a fresh one which is pre-configured for HSQLDB.  The contents of this file
                are as follows:

                You can change the database values and the hibernate dialect to match the settings of a 
                database that you have already.  When JTrac starts, it will connect to the database and
                create the schema if one does not already exist.

                If you edit the "jtrac.properties" file, ensure that there are no trailing spaces in the entries shown above

                Don't forget to make the database driver available for the web-application.  If you are using the bundled
                Jetty web-app server, this is as simple as copying the jar file into the "lib" folder along with the
                jetty jar files.  If you are using Tomcat, you can either place the jar file under "shared/lib" or within
                the "/WEB-INF/lib" folder of the "jtrac" (exploded) WAR itself.

                The default query to test idle database connections is "SELECT 1".  This has been reported
                to not work for databases such as Derby and Progress because they consider this invalid SQL.  You can
                customize the validation query by adding a "database.validationQuery" property in "jtrac.properties.
                If you set the validation query to an empty string, this effectively disables the periodic testing of
                idle database connections that Apache DBCP performs.

                Users still have to be created by an administrator and mapped to the relevant Spaces using the JTrac
                administration screens before they can start using JTrac.

                Note that this approach can reportedly apply to other operating systems.  If you have been able to do
                this successfully on Linux or Mac environments, please consider contributing some documentation on this.

            <para>                    
                If you choose to use the bundled <ulink url="http://jetty.mortbay.org/">Jetty</ulink> web-application 
                server, you can easily install JTrac as a Windows service so that it can start automatically when 
                the host machine is switched on.  One of the big advantages of this is that the console window will be invisible 
                and will run in the background.  You can therefore avoid the possibility of the Jetty server getting
                terminated because somebody decided to close "that pesky DOS Window that gets in the way".  Having JTrac
                start automatically without requiring someone to log-in is ideal when you have a server that may be
                restarted occasionally due to power outages or maintenance.
            </para>
            <para>
                JTrac can be configured as a Windows service by using the 
                <ulink url="http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/">Java Service Wrapper</ulink> project.  For convenience, 
                the JTrac distribution contains a "wrapper.conf" file in the "etc" folder that is pre-configured for 
                the Java Service Wrapper.  But first you have to download the Java Service Wrapper distribution separately.
                Note that the Java Service Wrapper project supports other operating systems such as Linux or Mac also.
            </para>
            <para>
                Place some of the files from the Java Service Wrapper distribution into the JTrac folder structure
                as follows:
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>From the "bin" folder, copy "wrapper.exe" to the "jtrac" root folder</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>From the "lib" folder, copy "wrapper.jar" and "wrapper.dll" into the "jtrac/etc" folder</para>
                    </listitem>                               
                </itemizedlist>                 
            </para>
            <para>
                To install JTrac as a windows service, open a command prompt, change to the "jtrac" directory
                (where you extracted the JTrac distribution) and run the following command:
            </para>
            <para>
                <programlisting>

wrapper.exe -i etc/wrapper.conf
                </programlisting>
            </para>
            <para>
                This will install a windows service called "JTrac-Jetty".  You can now go to the Windows -
                Control Panel :: Administrative Tools :: Services dialog to start the "JTrac-Jetty" service.
                Note that this service is configured to automatically start when Windows starts, by default.
                To remove the service, you can use the following command:
            </para>
            <para>
                <programlisting>

wrapper.exe -r etc/wrapper.conf
                </programlisting>
            </para>
            <para>
                The "wrapper.conf" file in the "etc" folder can be modified in case you need JTrac to run
                on a different port from the default (80).  Look for the "-Djetty.port=80" entry.
                When running as a service under the Java Service Wrapper, you can look at the
                "wrapper.log" file in the "jtrac/logs" folder for troubleshooting.

            <title>What to Backup</title>
            <para>
                Although in practice JTrac has been found to be extremely stable in production - to safeguard against
                hardware failures, you should regularly backup the database and stored attachments.  If you are using JTrac with 
                the embedded HSQLDB database, backing up the contents of "jtrac.home" will be sufficient.
                The HSQLDB data will be stored as files in a directory called "db" under the JTrac home.
            </para>
            <para>    
                If you are using the JTrac distribution as-is, i.e. if you are using the bundled Jetty application
                server - the JTrac home directory will be called "data" and this is created automatically under the
                folder where you un-zipped JTrac.                
            </para>
            <para>
                Of course, if you are using a different database you will have to backup the database separately.
                The "jtrac.home" would still need to be backed up because this is where uploaded attachments are stored.

            <para>
                JTrac can be installed in a few minutes without having to type any commands and you don't even need 
                to set-up a database.  Configuring an e-mail server for notifications is something easily done through 
                the user interface.  One of the reasons why many people choose JTrac over other open-source
                issue trackers or bug trackers is because of <link linkend="installation-quick">how easy it is to set up</link>.

            <para>
                JTrac is also written from the ground up to make use of the very best and latest in Java.  For example
                JTrac is developed using JDK 5.0 features, uses Apache Wicket, Spring and Hibernate and has full 
                internationalization support.
            </para>
            <para>
                JTrac is designed to be able to handle requirements management in the future and this an area where there 
                is a clear lack of open source tools that support the needs of agile development teams.  
                JTrac also has flexible workflow capabilities and offers a rare level of control over field-level 
                permissions.

                HSQLDB is surprisingly resilient and we have an instance of JTrac running in the place where
                I work that over a span of 2 years has accumulated more than 2000 items across multiple spaces

            </para>
            <para>
                But depending on what you are comfortable with, you can consider moving to another database if your usage

            <title>Why does JTrac have a limit on custom fields?  I really need more!</title>
            <para>
                JTrac provides an ample number of custom fields which can be used for all kinds of tracking needs.
                In very rare cases where people run out of custom fields, it is invariably for "free text" fields.
                The limit on custom fields is primarily for performance reasons especially where filtered searches 
                are involved.  So when JTrac introduces the feature of being able to "tag" items, these kinds of 
                things are likely to be covered.
            </para>
            <para>
                Anyway, if you really, really want more custom fields, the JTrac code is very clean and you can 
                easily customize a version that meets your requirements.  A few people have reported having 
                done this and for example -

                            Interim builds are provided only as WAR files.  If you are using the embedded Jetty
                            webapp-server, you have to replace the WAR that came along with the formal 
                            downloadable distribution.

                            When you are replacing the WAR file in an existing installation it is best that you 
                            delete the contents of the webapp-server temporary / work folder before re-starting.  
                            Details on how to do this are provided in the "<link linkend="upgrading">upgrading</link>"

                            In rare cases, there may be database schema changes.  This will be made clear in
                            the upload notification that is broadcast on the mailing-list.  If you wish to retain 
                            existing data, you will have to run a database upgrade script.  Details on how to do this are 
                            also provided in the "<link linkend="upgrading">upgrading</link>" section of this document.

                            Even if the database schema has changed, JTrac will re-create the database if one does
                            not exist on startup.  So when trying out the interim builds, this may be all that you really
                            want to do.  If you are using JTrac bundled with Jetty and / or with the embedded HSQLB database, 
                            removing the old database is as simple as deleting the "db" folder in which HSQLDB keeps
                            the data files.  Of course, you don't have to disturb your existing data at all since running a 
                            fresh instance of JTrac is as easy as extracting the distribution to a new directory.

            Upgrading to higher versions of JTrac is usually as simple as replacing the WAR file and deleting the web-app

            script for updating the database would then be provided.  It may also happen that upgrading the Jetty version would be 
            recommended in case you happen to be using the bundled Jetty webapp-server for deploying JTrac.

                In case you are using the bundled Jetty server in the JTrac distribution, you should delete the contents
                of the folder called "work".  Note that Jetty expects a folder called "work" to exist when it starts, 
                so ensure that you leave the empty "work" folder in place.

                If the JTrac release notes mention database schema changes, you need to additionally run an upgrade script
                before restarting the webapp-server with the new WAR in place.  Upgrade scripts come in the form of 
                <ulink url="http://www.beanshell.org/">Beanshell</ulink> scripts (*.bsh) and would be always released within
                the "etc" folder of the JTrac downloadable distribution.

            <para>
                These files are tested on HSQLDB and may need minor changes to work with
                other databases.  No re-compilation is needed, therefore making it extremely easy for you to tweak them 
                if required.  Of course it is strongly recommended that you backup your old data before an upgrade.

                            to make it easier - you can copy the beanshell jar and the hsqldb jar into the "db" folder of 
                            "jtrac.home".  The db folder will contain a "jtrac.script" file. There may also be a "jtrac.log" 
                            file. So when you are in the same directory as the HSQLDB data files, the URL is 
                            "jdbc:hsqldb:file:jtrac". Otherwise, replace the "jtrac" part in the URL with the relative or 
                            absolute path of where the "jtrac.script" file exists on your file-system.

                If you are using the embedded Jetty web-app server, you can also choose to upgrade the JAR files that 
                make up Jetty.  This is optional, but is as simple as overwriting the contents of the "lib" directory 
                with the corresponding files within the new distribution.  You can easily check if the Jetty related JAR 
                file versions have changed because the file-names clearly include the version numbers.

            <title>Database Migration</title>
            <para>
                Using the Beanshell based approach above, it is relatively straightforward to port data into another
                database.  This is useful especially in those cases where you start off using JTrac with the embedded
                HSQLDB database and then decide to scale up and move to something like MySQL.
            </para>
            <para>
                First, you should start the application re-configured to point to the new database and let JTrac
                do the hard work of creating all the database tables.  It is not necessary for Jtrac to be shut-down
                before proceeding with the next step,  but don't log-in yet!
            </para>
            <para>
                A Beanshell script called "jtrac-hsqldb-to-mysql.bsh" is available in the "etc" folder of the
                JTrac distribution.  You can execute this just like described in the previous section on upgrading.
                Note that you will need to have both the database drivers on the classpath in this case.  You should
                of course edit the database connection parameters (for database 1 and database 2) to suit your environment.
            </para>
            <para>
                This particular script is extremely generic and it should be possible to use this to migrate across
                combinations of databases other than HSQLDB and MySQL.

                The JTrac development environment uses Maven 2 only for dependency management and generating and deploying the JTrac 
                website hosted at SourceForge.  Almost all other development actions (clean, compile etc) are fired through
                a detailed Ant script that is able to use the dependency information managed by Maven.  Using Maven ensures that
                no binaries (JAR files) need to be checked into version control at all.
            </para>
            <para>
                You can get some idea about the details and rationale of the custom Ant + Maven integration approach from

            </para>
            <para>
                But if you are comfortable using Maven, the pom.xml is Maven 2 compliant which means that you can 
                <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/">directly build the war file</ulink> without Ant.
                You can even choose to use the <ulink url="http://mortbay.org/maven-plugin/">maven-jetty-plugin</ulink> by
                uncommenting the section in pom.xml that declares this.

                Although NetBeans is preferred by the JTrac developers, depending on an "IDE Neutral" Ant script
                ensures that you would easily be able to use Eclipse (or any other IDE of your choice) without any problems.

                Maven 2 should be in your "PATH".  You can test this out by opening a command prompt and trying to run the

                This step will not only download all the required JAR files (which may take time only for the first time),
                but also generate a standard properties file that will contain all the information required for
                the Ant build script to operate.  The file generated is called "build-deps.properties"
            </para>
            <para>
                Note that you need to perform this step every time the "pom.xml" file changes.  This happens rarely 
                and typically when newer versions of JTrac dependencies (e.g. Spring and Hibernate) are available.  Keep
                watching for changes in the versions of JTrac dependencies or specifically changes to "pom.xml" to avoid 
                any problems.

                If the command does not work, maybe you are not connected to the internet.  Here's a tip that may help if you 
                are behind an HTTP proxy.  This has been reported to work even when the proxy requires NTLM authentication.  
                You can append a parameter when running Maven commands as follows:

            <para>
                <programlisting>

mvn antprops:generate -Dhttp.proxyHost=172.19.56.56

            </para>
            <para>
                Note that if your proxy port is different from the default 80, you will have to add an "http.proxyPort" 
                parameter as well.

            <para>
                If you are a NetBeans user you are ready to build and run JTrac!  Just use the "Open Project"
                option from the "File" menu, browse to and select the "jtrac" folder.  You should be able to open it 
                as a valid NetBeans project.
            </para>
            <para>
                If you want to use Eclipse, that's easy as well.  First you have to run the following command and
                Maven will then generate the Eclipse project descriptor files for you.
            </para>
            <para>
                <programlisting>

            </para>
            <para>
                That should create the ".project" and the ".classpath" files.  Now its just a matter of
                importing "Existing Project into Workspace" within Eclipse.  Note that the Eclipse project descriptor
                files also need to be re-generated when JTrac dependencies change, i.e. when "pom.xml" changes.
                Make sure you do this also if you ever run "mvn antprops:generate".
            </para>
            <para>
                For Eclipse to work with Maven 2, you have to have a classpath variable called "M2_REPO" set correctly.

                While debugging, if you would like to step through the source of dependencies as well, you can tell Maven

            <para>
                You can explore all the Ant targets that are available. You can also try the "jetty-start" 
                Ant target straight away that will compile, create and deploy the exploded war as well as boot a Jetty server.
                For NetBeans users, the "jetty-start" target is conveniently mapped to the "Run Main Project (F6)" shortcut, 
                once you make JTrac the "main project".  Note that this Ant target is smart enough to detect if Jetty 
                is already running and will perform a shutdown if required before re-starting.
            </para>
            <para>
                When starting with freshly checked-out source code, the Ant script may prompt you for a JTrac Version
                and then create a "version.properties" file.  This process is just to make the JTrac release process easier 
                so it does not really matter what you type.  You would typically need to do this only once in development mode. 
            </para>            
            <para>
                Maven has been configured to download the Jetty web server which drastically reduces the amount of
                setup that you need to do in order to set up your development environment.  Since JTrac creates 
                the HSQLDB database if required on startup, you do not need to worry about  installing, configuring 
                and creating any database either.
            </para>
            <para>
                If you want to use Apache Tomcat instead of Jetty, just have "build.properties" point to a valid Tomcat instance.            
                By now, you may have noticed that because of the 
                <ulink url="http://ptrthomas.wordpress.com/2006/03/25/how-to-start-and-stop-tomcat-from-ant/">Ant script</ulink>, 
                you don't even need a Tomcat or Jetty plugin in either NetBeans or Eclipse.

        <sect1 id="dev-translating">
            <title>Adding a language translation for JTrac</title>
            <para>
                JTrac has full internationalization (i18n) support and you can easily add a new language without re-compiling JTrac.
                All you need to do is introduce a translated version of the existing "messages.properties" file into
                the "/WEB-INF/classes" folder.  Note that you will need to unzip the WAR file in order to add more files to it.
            </para>
            <para>
                For example, if you need to add a translation into French, a file called "messages_fr.properties" should exist.
                You can refer the list of Java locale codes 
                <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/intl/locale.doc.html">here</ulink>.  Note that country
                specific locales are also supported, for example "fr_CA" means "French, Canada".  
            </para>
            <para>
                You can look at the existing translations e.g. "messages_de.properties" as examples. Note that
                JTrac needs to be restarted for changes to the properties files to take effect.  However,
                switching the language for any user can easily be done anytime from the "Edit Your Profile" link on the
                options screen and this takes effect the instant the user saves his profile.
            </para>
            <para>
                You can also get the latest versions of the "messages.properties" as well as the available
                translations directly from version control at this url:
                <ulink url="http://j-trac.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/j-trac/trunk/jtrac/src/main/resources/"/>
                Since these may change a lot, it is recommended that you check here as well before submitting
                a translation.  We recommend that you submit translations as attachments on the 
                <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=825943&amp;group_id=162983">JTrac patches tracker</ulink> 
                where we keep track of code contributions as well.

            <para>                
                You can use this nice open-source tool called <ulink url="https://prbeditor.dev.java.net/">PRBEditor</ulink>
                that really helps by showing the English and translated versions side by side on a single screen.  It also
                takes care of handling special characters.
